## Revised Grail Psalter (2010)

https://archive.org/details/revisedgrailpsal0000unse/page/252/mode/2up

Praise, O servants of the Lord,
praise the name of the Lord!

May the name of the Lord be blest
both now and forevermore!

From the rising of the sun to its setting,
praised be the name of the Lord!

High above all nations is the Lord,
above the heavens his glory.

Who is like the Lord, our God,
who dwells on high,

who lowers himself to look down
upon heaven and earth?

From the dust he lifts up the lowly,
from the ash heap he raises the poor,

to set them in the company of princes,
yes, with the princes of his people.

To the childless wife he gives a home
as a joyful mother of children.

Praise, O servants of the Lord,
praise the name of the Lord!

May the name of the Lord be blessed
both now and for evermore!

From the rising of the sun to its setting
praised be the name of the Lord!

High above all nations is the Lord,
above the heavens his glory.

Who is like the Lord, our God,
who has risen on high to his throne

yet stoops from the heights to look down,
to look down upon heaven and earth?

From the dust he lifts up the lowly,
from the dungheap he raises the poor

to set him in the company of princes,
yes, with the princes of his people.

To the childless wife he gives a home
and gladdens her heart with children.

## English Standard Version

Praise, O servants of the Lord,
praise the name of the Lord!

Blessed be the name of the Lord
from this time forth and forevermore!

From the rising of the sun to its setting,
the name of the Lord is to be praised!

The Lord is high above all nations,
and his glory above the heavens!

Who is like the Lord our God,
who is seated on high,

who looks far down
on the heavens and the earth?

He raises the poor from the dust
and lifts the needy from the ash heap,

to make them sit with princes,
with the princes of his people.

He gives the barren woman a home,
making her the joyous mother of children.
