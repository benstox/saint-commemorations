O God, Creation’s secret Force,
Thyself unmov’d, all motion’s source,
Who from the morn, till ev’ning’s ray,
Through all its changes guid’st the day:

Grant us when this short life is past,
The glorious ev’ning that shall last:
That, by a holy death attain’d,
Eternal glory may be gain’d.

O Father, that we ask be done,
Through Jesus Christ, Thine Only Son;
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
Shall live and reign eternally. Amen.

Ant. The Apostles spoke in divers tongues 

(Phe) Thy testimonies are wonderful: * therefore my soul hath sought them.
The declaration of thy words giveth light: * and giveth understanding to little ones.
I opened my mouth, and panted: * because I longed for thy commandments.
Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me, * according to the judgment of them that love thy name.
Direct my steps according to thy word: * and let no iniquity have dominion over me.
Redeem me from the calumnies of men: * that I may keep thy commandments.
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: * and teach me thy justifications.
My eyes have sent forth springs of water: * because they have not kept thy law.
(Sade) Thou art just, O Lord: * and thy judgment is right.
Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: * and thy truth exceedingly.
My zeal hath made me pine away: * because my enemies forgot thy words.
Thy word is exceedingly refined: * and thy servant hath loved it.
I am very young and despised; but * I forget not thy justifications.
Thy justice is justice for ever: * and thy law is the truth.
Trouble and anguish have found me: * thy commandments are my meditation.
Thy testimonies are justice for ever: * give me understanding, and I shall live.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. 
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

(Coph) I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord: * I will seek thy justifications.
I cried unto thee, save me: * that I may keep thy commandments.
I prevented the dawning of the day, and cried: * because in thy words I very much hoped.
My eyes to thee have prevented the morning: * that I might meditate on thy words.
Hear thou my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy: * and quicken me according to thy judgment.
They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; * but they are gone far off from thy law.
Thou art near, O Lord: * and all thy ways are truth.
I have known from the beginning concerning thy testimonies: * that thou hast founded them for ever.
(Res) See my humiliation and deliver me: * for I have not forgotten thy law.
Judge my judgment and redeem me: * quicken thou me for thy word’s sake.
Salvation is far from sinners; * because they have not sought thy justifications.
Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: * quicken me according to thy judgment.
Many are they that persecute me, and afflict me; * but I have not declined from thy testimonies.
I beheld the transgressors, and I pined away; * because they kept not thy word.
Behold I have loved thy commandments, O Lord; * quicken me thou in thy mercy.
The beginning of thy words is truth: * all the judgments of thy justice are for ever.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. 
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

(Sin) Princes have persecuted me without cause: * and my heart hath been in awe of thy words.
I will rejoice at thy words, * as one that hath found great spoil.
I have hated and abhorred iniquity; * but I have loved thy law.
Seven times a day I have given praise to thee, * for the judgments of thy justice.
Much peace have they that love thy law, * and to them there is no stumbling-block.
I looked for thy salvation, O Lord: * and I loved thy commandments.
My soul hath kept thy testimonies: * and hath loved them exceedingly.
I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies: * because all my ways are in thy sight.
(Tau) Let my supplication, O Lord, come near in thy sight: * give me understanding according to thy word.
Let my request come in before thee; * deliver thou me according to thy word.
My lips shall utter a hymn, * when thou shalt teach me thy justifications.
My tongue shall pronounce thy word: * because all thy commandments are justice.
Let thy hand be with me to save me; * for I have chosen thy precepts.
I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; * and thy law is my meditation.
My soul shall live and shall praise thee: * and thy judgments shall help me.
I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: * seek thy servant, because I have not forgotten thy commandments.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. 
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
